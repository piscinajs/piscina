This section will guide you through the process of getting started with Piscina.js. We'll cover installation, basic usage, and configuration options to help you quickly integrate Piscina.js into your project.

To get started, you'll need to have Node.js version 16.x or higher installed on your system. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash tab={"label":"npm"}
npm install piscina
```
```bash tab={"label":"yarn"}
yarn add piscina
```
```bash tab={"label":"pnpm"}
pnpm add piscina
```
```bash tab={"label":"Bun"}
bun add piscina
```
:::note
While Bun can be used to install Piscina, its behavior while running within Bun is not assured.

This will download and install the latest version of Piscina.js and its dependencies.
Once you have Piscina.js installed, you can start using it in your code.
