For CPU-intensive tasks or when implementing workers in languages such as C++ or Rust, you can leverage Piscina's support for native addons as worker implementations. 

## Setup

First, get the example from the [Piscina GitHub repository](https://github.com/piscinajs/piscina/tree/current/examples/n-api).

Then install the dependencies:

```console
npm i
```

Build the native addon artifacts:

```console
npm run prebuild
```

The `prebuild` command will build the binary artifacts for the native
addon and will put them in the `prebuilds` folder. Because of how
prebuilds work, we need to use an intermediate JavaScript file to
load and export them. For this example native addon, you'll find
that in the `examples` folder.

The `index.js` illustrates how to load and use the native addon as the
worker implementation:

```js title="index.js"
const Piscina = require('piscina');
const { resolve } = require('path');

const pool = new Piscina({
  filename: resolve(__dirname, 'example')
});

(async () => {
  // Submit 5 concurrent tasks
  console.log(await Promise.all([
    pool.run(),
    pool.run(),
    pool.run(),
    pool.run(),
    pool.run()
  ]));
})();
```
